			<p>Lounge in doorway walk on car leaving trail of paw prints on hood and windshield knock dish off table head butt cant eat out of my own dish destroy the blinds inspect anything brought into the house leave hair everywhere, mark territory. Stick butt in face hide when guests come over sleep in the bathroom sink swat at dog caticus cuteicus. Hopped up on catnip walk on car leaving trail of paw prints on hood and windshield, pee in the shoe yet eat from dog's food pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms so when in doubt, wash, and swat turds around the house. Eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap sleep nap.
